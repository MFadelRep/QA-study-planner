# Current Study State

**State version:** 3.5-GITHUB-CHECKPOINT
**Last verified:** 2026-10-10
**Checkpoint:** SAVED — async/await slice verified
**Status:** ACTIVE — Day 1 / Hour 1 in progress
**Execution mode:** PROJECT-FIRST / FAST-PACE

## Position
- Day: 1
- Hour: 1
- Curriculum area: Programming + Terminal + Git Survival
- Current topic: TypeScript asynchronous test flow — Promise, async/await
- Project: AI QA Platform

## Verified project state
- Local Git repository initialized.
- Branch: main
- Initial root commit: `f2e8917`
- Commit message: `chore: initialize AI QA platform project`
- Repository was verified clean after the root commit.
- `.gitignore` exists and correctly ignores `node_modules/`.
- `src/` and `tests/` directories were created.
- `tsconfig.json` was created.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed after adding the TypeScript input.
- TS18003 was resolved by creating `src/index.ts`.
- `src/index.ts` contains the typed `TestResult` model and typed `reportResult(result: TestResult): void` reporter.
- Added `runLoginTest(): Promise<TestResult>` and `main(): Promise<void>`; `main()` awaits the login test and reports its resolved result.
- Removed the old synchronous `loginTest` object and `reportResult(loginTest)` call to prevent duplicate output.
- On 2026-10-10, the user ran `npx tsx src/index.ts` after implementing async/await; actual output was `Starting AI QA Platform` and `Login test: PASSED` exactly once.
- The user then ran `npx tsc --noEmit`; it produced no errors/output.
- The async/await slice is both type-checked and executed successfully.

## Latest verified result / blocker
- Type-check passed.
- Program execution passed with exactly one login result.
- No active blocker for this slice.

## Exact next action
Continue Hour 1 at fast pace with the next small project-first slice: add a short Promise-based delay so the simulated login operation is genuinely asynchronous, and update `reportResult()` to print `result.name` instead of hardcoding `Login test`. Explain only new syntax, request one focused edit/action, then verify with `npx tsx src/index.ts` and `npx tsc --noEmit` before advancing.

## Resume constraints
- Do not restart Git initialization, Git identity setup, or the successful initial commit.
- Do not return to the old standalone course directory.
- Do not assume a command succeeded without actual output.
- User wants every terminal command line and important syntax explained before execution.
- User explicitly requests fast pace: avoid unnecessary repetition while retaining one-action-per-turn and actual-output verification.
- The local AI QA Platform repository will be pushed to a separate GitHub repository. The GitHub repository containing this control center is for **study progress management only** and must not be used as the local project remote.
- The study-control repository is `MFadelRep/QA-study-planner` and is authoritative for study progress. Library copies are fallback/legacy only.
- For checkpoint writes: freshly read the file and SHA, preserve content with minimal edits, write using the current SHA, then read back and verify. If the Contents API write is blocked, use the lower-level Git blob/tree/commit/ref workflow with the current branch head and expected SHA.

## Longer-term project intent
Build one portfolio-grade AI QA Platform covering TypeScript, Playwright UI/API/fixtures/auth/network, PostgreSQL, CI/CD, performance testing, Docker, Kubernetes, AI/RAG evaluation, inference testing, security, and MLOps/MLflow.
